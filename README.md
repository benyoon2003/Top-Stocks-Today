# Top-Stocks-Today
This program scrapes different subreddits to find the most talked about stocks. 
The program first scrapes either r/wallstreebets, r/stocks, r/StockMarket, r/Stock_Picks, compares the words in the top 100 posts of the day to a list of all the stock
abbreviations on the NASDAQ. Finds the top three most mentioned stocks, and uses a yahoo finance API to pull all the info about the three stocks. The program then uses
tkinter to display all the info on the screen.
